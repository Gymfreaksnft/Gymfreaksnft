- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are @Gymfreaksnft
- ðŸ‘€ We are changing the NFT World.
- ðŸŒ± our collection is based on the crypto and freaks, did you ever thought
     that there was a time when Crypto was only known to the geeks ( no disrepect,
     as only the most intelligent were the first who believed and developed crypto)
     But as the crypto progressed everyone started getting interested in the crypto world,
     and today everyone around us is interested in crypto and nfts.
     so we started thinking what would happens if the crypto boom was taking place now
     (in 2021 ), as today many crypto-freaks are gym-freaks and one thing led to another.
     we were thinking how some iconic crypto projects would have changed and this led to
     the development of GYMFREAKSNFT.
     We worked on this project for about 16 months at FREAK_LABS as we wanted to give
     people much more than just a nft collection, we wanted to give people an ecosystem
     where everyone who gets involved grows.
